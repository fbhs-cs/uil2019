Why do you cry out thus, unless at some vision of horror? 
"The house reeks of death and dripping blood."
How so? Tis but the odor of the altar sacrifice. 
"The stench is like a breath from the tomb."
The darksome statesman, hung with weights and woe 
Like a thick midnight fog, moved there so slow
Now he did not stay, nor go. Now sir, young Fortinbras
Of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes 
For food and diet to some interprise that hath a stomach in it
The centurion commanded that they which could swim 
Should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land.
And the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship.
And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
In the afternoon they came unto a land in which it seemed always afternoon
All round the coast the languid air did swoon, 
Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.
