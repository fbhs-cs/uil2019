# UIL Computer Science 2018-2019

* This will be a repository to hold all of the written tests with sample input files and output files.  
* Feel free to clone this repository and create your solutions in the folders.
* If canonical solutions are available I will include them later in a folder called "Solutions".
* Remember, the tests get harder as you progress, that is:  Invitational A < Invitational B < District < Region < State.  
  * If you're trying to work your way up, I recommend starting with 2016 Invitational A and working as many of the problems as you can (it probably won't be very many to start), then go to Invitational B and do the same, then District.  
  * Don't work any problems from Regionals or State until you have completed more than half of the problems on the previous tests.
